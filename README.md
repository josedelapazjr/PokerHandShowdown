#Poker Hand Showdown
Implement a library (in C#) which evaluates who are the winner(s) among several 5 card poker hands. Note for this project that you only need to implement a subset of the regular poker hands:

* Flush* Three of a Kind* One Pair* High Card

### How your program should handle input and output
**Input**: Collection of players in the showdown.

* Player Name
* 5 Cards (each specifying the card rank and suit of the card)

**Output**: Collection of winning players (more than one in case of a tie)

**Note**: Please direct all output to the Console window (a GUI is not necessary for this task).


Limitations: 

* Currently, only able to display 1 winner at a time.
